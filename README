## Description
This repository is a collection of other repositories but boosted with build scripts. For example with minio, the primal package is downloaded to adapt it to our packaging system, generating the rpms and the iso.

### Building one package
build_modules -m <module_name>

### Building minio and uploading to devel
This command will build minio and upload it to devel's rbrepo
```
sudo DEVEL=<devel_name> VERSION=<x.y.z> ./build_module.sh -m minio
```

## Requirements
Packages needed:

Mock:
# yum install epel-release
# yum install mock

## Content
